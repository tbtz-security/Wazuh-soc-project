# 📊 SOC Incident Detection & Response Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents a simulated cyber attack detected and analyzed using **Wazuh SIEM** in a controlled SOC lab environment.

---

## 2. Lab Setup
Three virtual machines were deployed to simulate attacker, victim, and SOC infrastructure.

## 3. Wazuh Installation
The Wazuh SIEM server was installed in an all-in-one configuration.

## 4. Agent Deployment
The Wazuh agent was installed on the victim machine and successfully connected.

## 5. Attack Simulation
An SSH brute-force attack was launched from the attacker machine.

---

## 6. Alert Detection
Wazuh generated alerts indicating multiple failed SSH login attempts.

## 7. Incident Investigation
The alert was investigated by analyzing authentication logs.

## 7.1 Custom Detection & Automation

In addition to Wazuh’s built-in detection rules, a custom Python script was developed to demonstrate
how SOC analysts can automate log analysis and alert generation.

The script analyzed the Linux authentication log (`/var/log/auth.log`) and identified repeated failed
SSH login attempts from the same source IP address. When the number of failed attempts exceeded a
defined threshold, the script generated an alert indicating a possible brute-force attack.

This automation helped to:
- Reduce manual log review
- Quickly identify suspicious behavior
- Correlate multiple failed login events into a single alert
- Support faster incident triage and investigation

The script acted as an additional detection layer, complementing Wazuh SIEM alerts and reinforcing
defense-in-depth within the SOC workflow.
